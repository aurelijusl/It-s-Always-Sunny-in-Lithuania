`npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.\

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

About the app:

The app provides weather forecasts for most places in Lithuania. The data is pulled from https://api.meteo.lt/. It shows forecasts for the current week, shows temperature by timeframes, and let's you see which day of the week today is. You can use search functionality to get forecasts for different cities/towns.

- I used Cors-Unblock Chrome extension to go around CORS.


Areas that need improvement:

1. SEARCH BAR - I didn't have time to add proper search functionality, so you need to delete the existing text for it to dissapear.
2. STYLING - only had time to apply very basic styles and unfortunately, I didn't use any icons.
3. WEATHER GRID - there are empty places in the grid because API doesn't provide data for certain hours.
4. RESPONSIVENESS - unfortunately, I didn't had time to make the app responsive. This must be implemented.
5. TIMEFRAMES - I didn't include the 2:00 time, because it would take me a lot of time to find a solution on how to implement it.
